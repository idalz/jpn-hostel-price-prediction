    "## 2. The problem\n",
    "In recent years, the popularity of hostels as an accommodation option for travelers in Japan has surged due to their affordability and unique cultural experiences. However, determining the price per night for these hostels can be challenging, as it depends on various factors such as location, facilities, seasonality, and local events. This unpredictability makes it difficult for both travelers and hostel operators to set and estimate competitive prices."
